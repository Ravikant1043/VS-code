# There are two kinds of bots A and B in a 1-D array. A bot can only move left while B can only move right. There are also empty spaces in between represented by #. But its also given that the bots cannot cross over each other.

# Given the initial state and final state, we should tell if the transformation is possible.

# NOTE: There can be many bots of the same type in a particular array. 


# Example 1:

# Input:
# s1 = #B#A#
# s2 = ##BA#
# Output: Yes
# Explanation: Because we can reach the 
# final state by moving 'B' to the 
# right one step.

# Example 2:

# Input:
# s1 = #B#A#
# s2 = #A#B# 
# Output: No
# Explanation: Because the robots 
# cannot cross each other.

 

# Input:

# Two strings s1 and s2 will be given in two lines.


# Output:  
# To print if a valid transformation can be done. Print "Yes" if possible, else "No".
